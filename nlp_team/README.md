# NLP Team
The NLP Team, in collaboration with the [Crypto Team](https://github.com/OpenMined/Roadmap/tree/master/crypto_team), is on a mission to help bring privacy-preserving NLP to life. [SyferText](https://github.com/OpenMined/SyferText) is the library the team is currently building in an effort to create the first production-ready solution leveraging [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) to enable Natural Language Process that protects data and models' privacy.

## Roadmap (2020)

1. Building SyferText with production in mind.
  - Identifying at least three companies with a potential interest in using SyferText.
  - Building a collaboration around a real-world usecase with at least one company.

2. Focus on communication: OpenMined AMA, meetups, tutorials.

## Short-Term goals 

Here are some of the main SyferText features we are working on currently:

1. Perform the first encrypted federated training of a logistic regression model on two remote datasets (subsets of SST-2). *(Before March 19th 2020)*

2. Validate that such concurrent training on two datasets can boost performance compared to pretraining on one and fine tuning on the other. *(Before March 19th 2020)*

3. The ability to add the trained model to a pipeline of models that operate an a document. *(Before March 19th 2020)*

4. The ability to dump/load a language model with all of its pipes to/from disk. *(Before May 13th 2020)*
