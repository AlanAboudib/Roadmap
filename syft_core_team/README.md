# Syft Core Team Roadmap

Welcome to the Syft Core Team's Roadmap! This repository contains our short term (weekly) and medium term (3 - 6 months) development plans. This team is responsible for the develpment of core Syft features which affect all (or most) users of PySyft and Syft-lite libraries. We primarily work on development of PySyft and syft-proto.

## Team Members

## Projects

[You can view the current projects we're working on here](./projects). Each project includes our roadmap for at least the next 6 months, divided into individual projects with high level descriptions, example code, and links to Issues and Pull Requests across OpenMined's repositories.

## Weekly Meetings

We have weekly meetings that are currently private, [but we take detailed notes for each meeting](./meetings). Here you can will find our weekly status updates: where each member of our team has recorded what they worked on the previous week and what they plan to work on in the upcoming week.
